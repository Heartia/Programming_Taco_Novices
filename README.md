# Programming_Taco_Novices
Hello!

Within this repository comes most of the programming files that I made throughout 9th and 10th grade. This includes a random map generator, two visual games, one text based game and several algorithms necessary for competition.

1st and 2nd year practice files were made entirely for school projects, while the other work were projects either partially made for school but mostly improved on for practice/a portfolio or work made entirely for practice/a portfolio.

They were also all coded in Java, as that is the standard language for school.

Hope you enjoy!
