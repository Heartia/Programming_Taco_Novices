# Programming_Taco_Novices
Hello!

Within this repository comes most of the programming files that I made throughout 9th and 10th grade. This includes a random map generator, two visual games, one text based game and several algorithms necessary for competition.

These files were made both for school and for my own practice (in fact, most of these files were made for my own practice, or at least modified versions of school projects that I continue to work on).

They were also all coded in Java, as that is the standard language for school.

Hope you enjoy!
